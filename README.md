Architecture

This full-stack project employs Express HTML, MongoDB, Node.js, and Express and Angular.  Express is utilized as a server-side framework used to handle routing and HTTP requests.  Node.js is a runtime environment for the server that is used in partnership with Express. Angular is a front-end framework that uses JavaScript for building advanced and dynamic web applications. The choice of MongoDB as the backend database was due to its scalability and performance in relation to evolving data requirements and data management. 
Functionality
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is derived from JavaScript but entails simpler syntax that enables it to be transferred through networks to other computers more efficiently. This helps tie the frontend and backend together by bridging the components with a standard format for data representation. This is a common practice in data representation that facilitates seamless data communication across the program. 
This program also utilizes Handlebars to enhance the efficiency of rendering dynamic web pages. Handlebars is a templating component that simplifies the process of generating HTML by inserting data into templates, or “handlebars”. It provides an efficient way to create reusable templates for the user interface.


Testing

In a full-stack application, the effectiveness of the system's structure and security greatly relies on three key elements: methods, endpoints, and security. Methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE in HTTP, define how the system interacts with and manipulates data and resources. Endpoints, on the other hand, are like unique addresses or routes within the application, connecting these methods to specific functions and data sources. Security is a crucial aspect that involves various protective measures like user authentication, authorization, data encryption, and thorough input validation. These security practices are vital to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches, ensuring that the application remains resilient and trustworthy.


Reflection

This course has been instrumental in my understanding of the connection of the components of a functioning full-stack web application. Working on the MEAN stack for the entire course was very helpful in thoroughly comprehending the dynamic relationships between the RESTful APIs that created seamless communication between each component. This course combined the use of technical knowledge with practical experience, which I believe was extremely helpful.  Going forward, I plan to sharpen these skills so that I can successfully and securely contribute to advanced web development projects.
